## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To work with this project, you need the following tools installed:
- ** ISE / Vivado / Quartus / ModelSim / GHDL** (for synthesis and simulation)
- **VHDL Compiler** (for compiling the VHDL code)
- **Waveform Viewer** (for debugging and analyzing signals)

### Cloning the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Amin98Hosseini/FPGA-Project.git
cd FPGA-Project/VHDL
```

## Usage
1. Open the VHDL source files in your preferred FPGA development tool.
2. Run the testbench files in a simulator to verify functionality.
3. Synthesize and implement the design on an FPGA.
4. Check the waveform results and optimize the design if necessary.

## Features
- Modular VHDL design
- Testbench verification for each module
- FPGA constraints for different boards
- Optimized for synthesis and hardware implementation
