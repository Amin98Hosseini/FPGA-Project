## Overview
This project contains VHDL implementations of essential digital circuits and FPGA components, including:
- Basic logic gates and combinational circuits
- Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU)
- Memory elements (Flip-Flops, Registers)
- Serial communication modules (UART)
- PWM controller
- Seven-segment display driver

Designed for both educational purposes and practical FPGA implementation, these modules can be used as building blocks for more complex digital systems.

## Features
- **Core Components**:
  - Basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.)
  - 4-bit ALU with multiple operations
  - D Flip-Flops with various configurations
  - Memory registers and shift registers
- **Peripheral Interfaces**:
  - UART transmitter and receiver
  - PWM generator with adjustable duty cycle
  - Seven-segment display decoder
- **Utilities**:
  - Simulation testbenches for verification
  - Synthesizable code for Xilinx FPGAs
  - Clean hierarchy and modular design
